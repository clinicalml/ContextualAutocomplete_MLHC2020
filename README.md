# Contextual Autocomplete 

This is the codebase for the analyses used in the MLHC 2020 paper, **Fast, Structured Clinical Documentation via Contextual Autocomplete**.

It does not contain the full system implementation of the BIDMC-JClinic system. While the notebooks cannot be run by the general public as they require access to PHI-derived data and models, utility files to load and call autocomplete for conditions, symptoms, medications, and labs are given, along with iPython notebooks to replicate the Results section of the paper.
